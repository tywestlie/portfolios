## What was your biggest achievement of the module?
I think my biggest achivement the module has been getting comfortable making a REST API in Go. The langauge is quite different from Ruby and JavaScript what I'm used to but I was able to pick up the important pieces and build an application in a very short period of time. 

## What provided you with the most struggle? What did you learn from that struggle?
I was challenged with the capstone project this module. Building a Rails API was pretty straight forward, and did not struggle with the design and implementation of the endpoints. The part I found challenging was working with an individual from another disciplne. 

## What have you done this inning that sets you apart from your peers?

## How did your Mod 4 experience with this part of the stack (e.g. front-end technologies for BE students/back-end technologies for FE students) impact what you wanted to be doing after Turing? How did it reframe what you learned in previous modules?

## What is the most important skill or lesson that you will take from Turing into your next job?
